# ChiLin

ChiLin is a pipeline for ChIP-seq data written in pure Python. It provides workflow of mapping(Bowtie),
peak calling(MACS2), Cis-elementary visualization(CEAS) and motif finding(MDSeqpos). Moreover, it provides quality
control tools for reads, replication and peaks. It's intended to do more things
with less configuration.
